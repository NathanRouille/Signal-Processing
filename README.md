- **Objective**: Implement efficient sampling rate conversion using polyphase decomposition, and explore STFT for audio equalization.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Sampling rate conversion from 48kHz to 32kHz using optimal digital filter design.
  - Polyphase decomposition for efficient multirate processing.
  - Implementation and interpretation of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
  - Reconstruction of signals using overlap-add methods.
  - Application of STFT for building an audio equalizer.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Design and implementation of digital filters using Python libraries.
  - Optimization of signal processing chains with polyphase methods.
  - Practical use of the STFT for signal analysis and manipulation.
  - Audio signal processing and visualization.

## Lab 2: Image Compression Using Wavelet Transform
- **Objective**: Analyze and compress images using wavelet decomposition.
- **Key Topics**:
  - Construction and application of wavelets for image processing.
  - Multilevel wavelet decomposition and reconstruction.
